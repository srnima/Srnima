--># About Me

I'm srNima — an engineer who lives through technology, repair, teaching, and building new chapters in the digital world.

With deep experience in repairing mobile phones, laptops, and desktop systems, my work includes installing custom operating systems (AndroidOS, LineageOS, Linux), optimizing CPU and fan performance, and documenting full boot and repair processes. But beyond technical skills, my mission is to make technology understandable, accessible, and inspiring — for children, beginners, and professional engineers alike, in every country.

I live with a wheelchair and artificial spinal implants (T5–T6), but I've never been limited. For me, technology is not just a tool — it's a shared language for building, teaching, and connecting with the world.

I plan to travel across Europe — including Germany — to teach children and engineers how to repair, optimize, and understand technology. Every project you see here is part of that journey: chapters written with precision, care, and hope.
