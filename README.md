# Hi there 👋 

## About Me
I'm **srNima** — an engineer who lives through technology, repair, teaching, and building new chapters in the digital world.

With deep experience in repairing mobile phones, laptops, and desktop systems, my work includes installing custom operating systems (AndroidOS, LineageOS, Linux), optimizing CPU and fan performance, and documenting full boot and repair processes.  
Beyond technical skills, my mission is to make technology understandable, accessible, and inspiring — for children, beginners, and professional engineers alike, in every country.

I live with a wheelchair and artificial spinal implants (T5–T6), but I've never been limited. For me, technology is not just a tool — it's a shared language for building, teaching, and connecting with the world.

I plan to travel across Europe — including Germany — to teach children and engineers how to repair, optimize, and understand technology. Every project you see here is part of that journey: chapters written with precision, care, and hope.

# Season: XboX 🎮
Focus exclusively on **Xbox Series X|S**

## 🛠️ Goals of the Season
- Document and analyze Xbox Series S/X hardware  
- Record thermal and performance tests before/after cleaning and repair  
- Archive emergency and creative tricks  
- Compare with older consoles (Xbox 360)  
- Buildsupportingg tools and scripts  

## 🔧 Emergency Trick – Replacing Thermal Paste
- **Issue:** Consoletempperatree before cleaning reached 60–65°C.  
- **Action:** Full disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly.  
- **Challenge:** No proper thermal paste available.  
- **Solution:** Folded medium-thickness aluminum foil (~1×0.5 cm) placed between APU and heatsink.  
- **Result:** Temperature dropped by ~30°C, with no contact to the board or sensitive components.  

⚠️ This method is only an **emergency workaround** and not a permanent replacement for thermal paste.  
A reliable product such as **DeepCool Z5** is recommended for long-term stability.

## 📊 Next Tests
- Run heavy games (Resident Evil, Forza Horizon) to check stable temperatures  
- Record thermal logs before and after applying proper paste  
- Compare fan behavior and noise levels

## 🎮 Xbox GamePass Library – Installed Titles  

### 🟩 AAA Titles
- **Hogwarts Legacy**  
- **Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5)**

# MOBILE — Mobile Kernel Engineering & Hardware Analysis  
Created, documented and engineered by **srNima**  
Advanced Documentation • Deep Kernel Tuning • Visual Technical Resume

---

## 1. Device Profile (J700H)
| Component | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Owner / Engineer | **srNima** |
| Model | Samsung Galaxy J700H |
| SoC | Exynos 7580 (8× Cortex-A53) |
| GPU | Mali-T720 MP2 |
| RAM | 1.5–2GB LPDDR3 |
| Storage | eMMC 5.0 |
| Kernel Base | Linux 3.10.x |
| ROM | LineageOS |
| CCustomKernel | kernel-final+ |

---

## 2. Kernel Feature Overview (kernel-final+)
Maintained, tuned and tested by **srNima**

- Custom CPU hotplug driver (Lazypug)
- Advanced I/O scheduler tuning
- ZRAM compression support (lz4, lzo, zstd)
- TCP congestion control suite (Westwood, Cubic, Reno, BIC, HTCP)
- Power Suspend modes (Kernel, Hybrid, LCD Hooks)
- Fsync toggle
- VM tuning hooks
- Misc block-layer optimizations

---

## 3. CPU Management (Lazypug)

### Recommended Configuration (Performance-Balanced)
Optimized and validated by **srNima**

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Profile | Balanced | Best balance between responsiveness and battery |
| Touch Boost | Enabled | Faster touch response |
| Hysteresis Value | 1–2 | Faster reaction to load changes |
| CPU Threshold | 6 | Activates cores at the right time |
| Max CPU Online | 8 | Full use of all A53 cores |

### Technical Notes
- Lower threshold → cores activate sooner → better performance  
- Higher threshold → lower battery usage but possible micro-lag  
- Lazypug replaces MPDecision with more stable behavior

---

## 4. Virtual Memory (ZRAM)

### Recommended Configuration
| Setting | Value |
|--------|--------|
| ZRAM Disksize | 1024MB |
| Compression Algorithm | lz4 |

### Technical Notes
- lz4 is the fastest algorithm for low-RAM devices  
- 1024MB is the sweet spot between performance and RAM pressure  
- Higher than 1.5GB may cause stalls on J700H

---

## 5. Network Stack (TCP Congestion Control)

### Recommended Algorithm: Westwood
| Algorithm | Use-Case | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Westwood | Mobile/Wi-Fi | Best for unstable networks |
| Cubic | Stable networks | Default in modern kernels |
| Reno | Legacy | Only for testing |
| BIC | Aggressive | Not recommended |
| HTCP | Datacenter | Not suitable for mobile |

---

## 6. Power Suspend

### Recommended Mode: Hybrid
- Smart balance between Kernel Mode and LCD Hooks  
- Lower idle consumption  
- No lag on wake-up

---

## 7. Filesystem & I/O

| Setting | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Fsync | OFF | Faster I/O (small risk on crash) |
| I/O Stats | ON | For monitoring |
| Rotational Storage | OFF | Device uses eMMC |
| Add Random | OFF | Only useful for HDD |
| RQ Affinity | 2 | Best for multi-core |
| No-Merges | 1 | More accurate block-layer behavior |
| NR Requests | 256 | Good for eMMC 5.0 |
